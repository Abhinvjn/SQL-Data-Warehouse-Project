🚀 Project Requirements

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior

Product Performance

Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
